### 1. What is Networking?

#### Task 1. What is Networking?

- Networks are connection of things. In terms of computing, it is thepractice of connecting computers so they can share resources and information.

#### Task 2. What is the Internet?

- The internet is a giant network consisting of small networks. Small networks are called private networks and connecting these small networks become public networks.
- The first iteration of the internet was within ARPANET in 1960 but it wasn't until 1989 that Tim Berners-Lee created the **World Wide Web** or Internet as we know.

#### Task 3. Identifying Devices on a Network

- To maintain order, devices should be able to identify and be identifiable in a network.
- Like humans, devices also have fingerprints of their own. Two means of identification are IP address and MAC address
- An **Internet Protocol** or IP address identifies a device’s location on a network, while a **Media Control Access**  or MAC address uniquely identifies the device’s physical hardware.

  ##### IP Address

  - An IP address is divided into 4 octets. Private IP addresses are used for communication within a local network, while public IP addresses (assigned by your ISP) are used when communicating over the Internet.

  - 👉 IPv4 has about 4.3 billion addresses and is running out, while IPv6 provides a much larger address space and improved features.

  ##### MAC Address

  - Every device has a physical network interface with a unique MAC address, a 12-character hexadecimal identifier; the first half identifies the manufacturer, and the second half is unique to the device.

    💡 Trivia: Did you know that MAC addresses can be spoofed? A device can pretend to use another device’s MAC, which can trick firewalls or Wi-Fi networks that rely only on MAC filtering.
